title: OpenClaw Integration
---

This page documents how ClawControl integrates with OpenClaw in the current implementation.

## Supported Binary and Version Expectation

- Supported binary: `openclaw`
- Minimum version expectation in code/docs: `0.1.0`
- CLI resolution supports explicit `OPENCLAW_BIN` override and common install paths

## Dependency Layers (Important)

ClawControl separates dependency health into two layers:

1. **Gateway reachability** (HTTP/WS probe).
2. **OpenClaw CLI availability** (binary + command execution).

These are intentionally independent. A reachable gateway does **not** guarantee CLI-backed features are available.

CLI-backed surfaces in this release include:

- maintenance actions and recovery
- models
- plugins
- cron
- capability probing

## Discovery and Resolution Behavior

Config resolution combines (in priority order):

1. ClawControl settings (`settings.json`)
2. environment variables
3. OpenClaw config discovery (`~/.openclaw`, `~/.OpenClaw`, `~/.moltbot`, `~/.clawdbot`)
4. default loopback gateway URLs

## Capability Probing

Capabilities endpoint probes OpenClaw and returns feature support map. Results are cached briefly and can be refreshed.

## Command Safety Model

- OpenClaw execution is allowlist-based.
- Commands run via `spawn` with array args (no shell interpolation).
- Dynamic command forms enforce required params.
- Command execution results are logged in receipts.

## Unavailable / Degraded Behavior

When OpenClaw is unavailable:

- API responses return unavailable/degraded states or errors per endpoint contract.
- UI renders empty or unavailable states using real data contracts.
- No fake/demo fallback data is generated.

CLI-dependent API failures include additive metadata:

- `code`: `CLI_UNAVAILABLE`, `CLI_JSON_PARSE_FAILED`, `OPENCLAW_COMMAND_FAILED`
- `fixHint`: actionable remediation text when available
