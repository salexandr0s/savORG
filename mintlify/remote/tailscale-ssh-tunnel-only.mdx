title: Tailscale Tunnel (SSH Port Forwarding)
---

This page documents the only supported remote-access model.

## Policy

- Host machine keeps ClawControl bound to loopback (`127.0.0.1:3000`).
- Remote machine accesses host via SSH local forwarding over tailnet.
- `tailscale serve` is not allowed for ClawControl.

## Host Steps

1. Start ClawControl normally.
2. Verify loopback listener.

```bash
lsof -nP -iTCP:3000 -sTCP:LISTEN
```

## Remote Steps

```bash
ssh -L 3000:127.0.0.1:3000 <user>@<host-tailnet-name>
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:3000` on the remote machine.

## Not Allowed (repeated for operator safety)

- `tailscale serve`
- non-loopback bind
- reverse proxy/public tunnel exposure
