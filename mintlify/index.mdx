title: ClawControl
---

ClawControl is a local-first operations console for OpenClaw orchestration. This site documents the implemented product behavior in the current repository.

## What ClawControl Is

- A Next.js app with a local API layer, SQLite persistence, and a dashboard for work orchestration.
- An Electron desktop wrapper that starts and supervises the same local server.
- A governance-first console with typed confirmations, approval gates, receipts, and activity audit trails.

## Non-negotiable Operating Model

- ClawControl is loopback-only by default (`127.0.0.1` / `::1`).
- `0.0.0.0` bind strategy is not supported for ClawControl docs or operations.
- Remote access is tunnel-only (including Tailscale-over-SSH tunnel), never `tailscale serve`.
- Desktop app releases are currently unsigned; trust/install guidance is mandatory.
- OpenClaw-backed pages use real data only. No fake/demo fallback is used when OpenClaw is unavailable.
