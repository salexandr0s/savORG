title: Release Artifacts and Checksums
---

This page summarizes release distribution details currently implemented in CI workflow.

## Workflow Facts

Release workflow:

- builds desktop artifacts on macOS
- runs packaged runtime smoke test
- generates `SHA256SUMS.txt`
- publishes artifacts in GitHub release
- includes unsigned app note and local-only remote access policy note

## Operator Verification Steps

1. Download artifacts and `SHA256SUMS.txt`.
2. Verify checksums:

```bash
cd <download-folder>
shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS.txt
```

3. Launch using unsigned-app trust guidance.

## Release Notes Expectations

Release body should continue to include:

- checksum verification commands
- unsigned desktop warning
- local-only + tunnel-only remote policy
