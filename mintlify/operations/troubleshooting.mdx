title: Troubleshooting
---

This page is the troubleshooting index for ClawControl operators.

## Common Incident Areas

- startup failures
- port conflicts
- OpenClaw missing/unavailable
- gateway auth-required responses
- workspace validation failures
- loopback policy violations
- unsigned desktop launch friction

## First-response Checks

1. Confirm local listeners are loopback only.
2. Confirm database path and migration state.
3. Check **both** dependency layers:
   - gateway reachability in settings/topbar
   - CLI availability/version in settings
4. Confirm OpenClaw CLI exists on PATH (or `OPENCLAW_BIN` is set).
5. Re-run gateway test from setup/settings flow.
6. Refresh capabilities (`/api/openclaw/capabilities?refresh=1`) and retry.
7. Check activity/receipt logs for failed operations.
