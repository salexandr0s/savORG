title: Loopback Policy Violations
---

This page describes diagnosis/remediation when local-only policy is violated.

## What Violates Policy

- binding ClawControl to non-loopback interfaces
- attempting to expose via `tailscale serve`
- reverse proxy/public tunnel exposure

## Detection

- `403` response from proxy host guard for non-loopback host headers
- startup guard failure from local-only script
- listener checks showing `0.0.0.0` instead of loopback

## Verification Commands

```bash
lsof -nP -iTCP:3000 -sTCP:LISTEN
lsof -nP -iTCP:18789 -sTCP:LISTEN
```

Expected: `127.0.0.1` and/or `::1` only.

## Required Remediation

1. remove non-loopback host env overrides
2. stop unsupported exposure tooling
3. restart ClawControl in local-only mode
4. use SSH tunnel workflow for remote operations
