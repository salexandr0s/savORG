title: Startup Failures and Port Conflicts
---

This page covers startup and binding failures.

## Symptoms

- app fails to open or exits immediately
- backend does not respond at `127.0.0.1:3000`
- desktop reports local server startup failure

## Port 3000 Conflict

```bash
lsof -nP -iTCP:3000 -sTCP:LISTEN
```

If occupied by unrelated process, stop that process or choose an alternate run strategy.

## Port 18789 Conflict (OpenClaw Gateway)

```bash
lsof -nP -iTCP:18789 -sTCP:LISTEN
```

If gateway is not reachable, setup/init status will report gateway warning/error.

## Local-only Guard Failures

ClawControl startup will refuse host env values that are not loopback.

Check and unset bad values:

```bash
echo "$HOST $HOSTNAME"
```

## Recovery Actions

- run setup checks again (`/setup`)
- use maintenance page health/recovery actions
- inspect receipts for command-level error output
