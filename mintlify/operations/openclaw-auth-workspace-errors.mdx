title: OpenClaw, Auth-required, and Workspace Errors
---

This page covers the most common integration and configuration failures.

## OpenClaw Not Found

Symptoms:

- init status warns OpenClaw not installed
- OpenClaw-backed pages show unavailable/empty states

Checks:

```bash
which openclaw
openclaw --version
```

## Gateway Auth-required State

Gateway probe can return `auth_required`.

- configure token in settings when required
- retest gateway from setup/settings page
- confirm gateway URL remains loopback-hosted

## Workspace Validation Errors

Common validation codes/messages include:

- workspace not configured
- workspace not found
- workspace not directory
- root `AGENTS.md` missing

Fix by setting valid `workspacePath` in settings and ensuring required root files exist.

## Real-data-only Reminder

Unavailable OpenClaw integration does not trigger demo data fallback. Empty states are expected until real OpenClaw connectivity is restored.
