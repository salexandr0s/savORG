title: Unsigned Desktop Install Guidance
---

This page documents required trust steps for current desktop releases.

## Current Trust Model

ClawControl desktop artifacts are currently unsigned.

On first macOS launch, use:

1. right-click app
2. choose **Open**
3. confirm Gatekeeper bypass prompt

## Security Expectations

- download from trusted project releases
- verify checksums before installation
- keep app local-only; unsigned status does not justify wider network exposure

## Verify Artifact Integrity

```bash
cd <download-folder>
shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS.txt
```
