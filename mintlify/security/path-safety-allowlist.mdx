title: Workspace Path Safety
---

This page documents workspace filesystem safety controls.

## Path Validation Controls

Workspace path policy rejects:

- traversal attempts (`..`)
- invalid characters (including backslash and null byte)
- escapes outside resolved workspace root
- symlink escapes after realpath resolution

## Workspace Root Resolution

Root resolves from a fallback chain:

1. settings workspace path
2. env vars
3. discovered OpenClaw config workspace
4. known workspace directories
5. nearest marker files
6. local fallback

## Allowlisted Top-level Directories

Implemented allowlisted workspace directories include:

- `agents`, `overlays`, `skills`, `playbooks`, `plugins`, `agent-templates`
- `memory`, `life`, `docs`, `tools`, `templates`, `canvas`, `projects`

Strict mode can enforce root allowlist behavior with `CLAWCONTROL_WORKSPACE_ALLOWLIST_ONLY=1`.

## Workspace Validation

Workspace validation checks include:

- path exists and is directory
- required `AGENTS.md` at workspace root
- warnings for recommended structures (for example `memory/`, `agents/`, agent `SOUL.md` presence)
