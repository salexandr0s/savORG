title: Run the Desktop App
---

This path runs ClawControl through the Electron wrapper.

## Development Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/salexandr0s/ClawControl.git
cd ClawControl
npm install
npm run db:migrate
npm run build --workspace=clawcontrol
./start.sh --desktop
```

## What Happens

- Desktop app starts a local server on `127.0.0.1:3000` if needed.
- If port `3000` is already in use, startup fails and desktop exits.
- Workspace picker and restart hooks are available in desktop mode.

## Security Constraints

- Desktop mode still enforces loopback-only behavior.
- Remote access remains tunnel-only.
- Never expose ClawControl via `tailscale serve`.
