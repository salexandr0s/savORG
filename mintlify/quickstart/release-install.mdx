title: Install From GitHub Releases
---

Use this path for packaged desktop artifacts from GitHub Releases.

## Install Steps

1. Download desktop artifact and `SHA256SUMS.txt` from a release.
2. Verify checksum locally.
3. Install app (drag to Applications on macOS when applicable).
4. First launch: right-click app and choose **Open** (unsigned app trust path).

## Checksum Verification

```bash
cd <download-folder>
shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS.txt
```

Expected output: `OK` for each artifact.

## Important

- Current desktop app is unsigned.
- Trust bypass step is required for first launch on macOS Gatekeeper.
- This does not change local-only network policy.
