title: Workspace Files (AGENTS.md and Agent Memory)
---

ClawControl is **workspace-backed**: it reads and writes files under your configured OpenClaw workspace (for example `~/OpenClaw`).

This page documents the **minimum file contract** you should keep in place, especially when installing the **ClawControl Starter Pack** (teams + workflows + templates).

## Workspace Root

Required:

- `AGENTS.md`
  - Global agent/governance rules for this workspace.
  - ClawControl will create a minimal stub **create-if-missing** on first run, but you should fill it in.

Recommended:

- `MEMORY.md`
  - Workspace-wide memory (shared context, decisions, conventions).
  - Keep it short, current, and free of secrets.

## Per-Agent Files

For each agent id/slug `<id>`, use:

- `agents/<id>/SOUL.md`
  - Identity, non-negotiable rules, and what “good” means for that agent.
- `agents/<id>/HEARTBEAT.md`
  - What to check and how to report when a heartbeat is requested.
- `agents/<id>/MEMORY.md`
  - Long-term notes that agent should remember (preferences, pitfalls, project norms).
  - Treat as curated context, not a dump of logs.

Optional (but common):

- `agents/<id>.md`
  - Overlay/prompt glue used by some OpenClaw setups to define role-level behavior.

## Minimal `AGENTS.md` Skeleton

```md
# AGENTS.md — Workspace Rules

## Core Rules
- Workflow-only execution (Manager Stage Engine).
- PlanReview required before Build/UI/Ops.
- Security veto is final.

## Default CEO Inbox
- OpenClaw runtime agent `main` is the default CEO inbox in ClawControl.

## Agent Hierarchy
- CEO: main
- Manager: manager
- Specialists: research, plan, plan_review, build, build_review, ui, ui_review, security, ops

## Tool Policy (Example)
- Do not run destructive commands without explicit approval.
- Do not exfiltrate secrets or internal workspace data.
```

## Starter Pack Notes

- Starter packs intentionally **do not overwrite** your existing `AGENTS.md` or global workspace memory.
- After importing and deploying a starter pack, instantiate the team's agents from **Agents → Teams** to materialize per-agent files (create-if-missing).
- If you install a starter pack into an empty workspace, ClawControl will scaffold `AGENTS.md` plus `agents/main/SOUL.md` and `agents/main/HEARTBEAT.md` create-if-missing.
