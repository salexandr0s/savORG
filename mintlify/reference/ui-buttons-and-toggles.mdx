title: UI Buttons and Toggles
---

This page defines the canonical button, segmented-toggle, and dropdown/menu styles used in ClawControl.

## Source of Truth

- `@clawcontrol/ui` `Button` and `buttonLikeClass`
- `@clawcontrol/ui` `SegmentedToggle`
- `@clawcontrol/ui` `SelectDropdown` and `DropdownMenu`
- Legacy CSS classes (`.btn-primary`, `.btn-secondary`) are compatibility-only and should not be used in new code.

## Button Variants

- `primary`: main positive action on a surface
- `secondary`: neutral actions
- `ghost`: low-emphasis actions
- `danger`: destructive actions (delete, uninstall, hard reject)

## Button Sizes

- `xs`: dense controls and compact toolbars
- `sm`: default page header actions
- `md`: modal footer and form actions
- `icon`: icon-only button layout

## Segmented Toggles

- `tone="neutral"`: tabs/view switches such as Agents/Teams/Stations or List/Hierarchy
- `tone="accent"`: when selected state should be emphasized (for example compact layout mode toggles)

## Dropdowns and Menus

- `SelectDropdown`: value selection controls in toolbars, forms, modals, and cards
  - `tone="toolbar"`: compact filter/sort controls
  - `tone="field"`: standard form/editor controls
  - Keyboard contract: `ArrowUp/Down`, `Enter`, `Escape`, `role="listbox"` / `role="option"`
  - Search defaults to `search="auto"` and appears for larger option sets
- `DropdownMenu`: action menus (for example “New File / New Folder”)
  - Keyboard contract: `role="menu"` / `role="menuitem"`
  - Use semantic danger menu items for destructive actions only
  - Prefer portal-based rendering to avoid clipping in scroll containers

## Do / Don't

- Do use `Button` for user-facing actions on pages, drawers, and modal footers.
- Do use `buttonLikeClass` for anchor/label elements that must look like buttons.
- Do use `SegmentedToggle` instead of hand-rolled segmented button groups.
- Do use `SelectDropdown` instead of native `<select>` for primary app controls.
- Do use `DropdownMenu` instead of ad-hoc absolute-positioned popovers.
- Don't add new `btn-primary` / `btn-secondary` usage.
- Don't use ad-hoc action classes for non-danger actions.
- Don't introduce new native OS dropdowns for primary app controls.

## Exceptions

- Tiny icon-only utility controls (dismiss, collapse, row affordances) may remain bespoke if they are not primary user actions.
- Semantic status badges are not action buttons and are not covered by this spec.
