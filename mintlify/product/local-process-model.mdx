title: Process Model

This page describes how ClawControl processes run in web and desktop modes.

## Web-only Runtime

- Server process runs from `apps/clawcontrol` using Next.js.
- Startup scripts use local-only guard to force loopback host values.
- Typical local endpoint: `http://127.0.0.1:3000`.

## Desktop Runtime

- Electron main process launches and monitors local Next server.
- Desktop wrapper checks local port readiness and exits on unrecoverable startup failures.
- Packaged mode uses standalone Next build output bundled into desktop resources.

## Local-only Enforcement Points

- Script guard: `/apps/clawcontrol/scripts/local-only.mjs`
- Proxy host check: `/apps/clawcontrol/proxy.ts`
- Settings API URL validation: `/api/config/settings`

## Remote Control Pattern

- Host stays loopback-only.
- Operator uses SSH local forwarding, including over Tailscale.
- App behavior and docs explicitly reject `tailscale serve` exposure model.
