title: Core Concepts
---

This page defines the primary data and control concepts used throughout ClawControl.

## Work Orders

Work orders are the top-level planning and delivery unit.

- States: `planned`, `active`, `blocked`, `review`, `shipped`, `cancelled`.
- Priorities: `P0` to `P3`.
- Ownership model includes owner type (`user`, `agent`, `system`) and optional `ownerAgentId`.
- Stored in SQLite (`work_orders` table).

## Operations

Operations are executable units linked to a work order.

- Statuses: `todo`, `in_progress`, `blocked`, `review`, `done`, `rework`.
- Stations identify pipeline position (for example `spec`, `build`, `qa`, `ops`, `ship`, `compound`).
- Operations can track assignees and dependencies.

## Receipts

Receipts are execution logs and evidence.

- Capture command identity, args, output excerpts, duration, and exit code.
- Can be streamed in real time via SSE (`/api/stream/receipts/:id`).
- Are used by maintenance, console actions, provisioning/test flows, and other operational APIs.

## Governor + Approvals

Protected actions use policy enforcement from `@clawcontrol/core`.

- Policy attributes: risk level, confirmation mode, and approval requirement.
- Confirmation modes: `NONE`, `CONFIRM`, `WO_CODE`.
- Approval states: `pending`, `approved`, `rejected`.
- Server routes enforce policy server-side using `withGovernor` (route wrapper) and `enforceActionPolicy` / `enforceGovernor` (helpers).

## Agents

Agents represent orchestrated workers and higher-level roles.

- Kind values include `worker`, `manager`, `ceo`, `guard`.
- Dispatch eligibility and WIP limit are tracked per agent.
- Runtime linkage uses `sessionKey` / `runtimeAgentId` and telemetry from OpenClaw sessions.

## Workspace

Workspace is the controlled filesystem surface.

- Root path is resolved from settings/env/config fallback chain.
- Path validation blocks traversal, invalid path characters, and symlink escapes.
- Root-level exposure can be constrained by allowlist mode.
