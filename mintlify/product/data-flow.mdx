title: Data Flow
---

This page tracks key request/data paths from UI action to persistence and audit.

## Work Order Update Flow

1. UI action calls `/api/work-orders` or `/api/work-orders/:id`.
2. Governor checks run for protected transitions.
3. Repository updates SQLite rows.
4. Activity records are written.
5. Updated DTOs return to UI.

## Protected Action Flow (Typed Confirm)

1. Client includes `typedConfirmText` in request body.
2. Route enforces policy via `withGovernor` (wrapper) or `enforceActionPolicy` / `enforceGovernor` (helpers).
3. Invalid/missing confirmation returns `403` or `428` with policy metadata (depending on the route).
4. If allowed, action executes and logs activity/receipt data.

  participant UI as UI

  participant Repo as Repos (SQLite/FS)
  participant Audit as Activities/Receipts

  UI->>API: POST /api/... (typedConfirmText)
  API->>Gov: withGovernor / enforceActionPolicy

  alt Not allowed
    Gov-->>API: denied (policy + reason)
    API-->>UI: 403/428 error response
  else Allowed
    Gov-->>API: allowed
    API->>Repo: mutate state
    Repo->>Audit: write activities + receipts
    API-->>UI: 200/201 { data }
  end
```

## Console Message Flow

- Agent-scoped send: `/api/openclaw/console/sessions/:id/send` (`console.agent.chat`).
- Session-scoped chat: `/api/openclaw/console/sessions/:id/chat` (`console.session.chat`, true session routing by session key).
- Both paths create receipts and activity entries.

## Workspace Edit Flow

1. UI resolves file entry ID.
2. Route validates path policy and protected-file rules.
3. Optional typed-confirm gate applies based on action/file.
4. Filesystem write is performed.
5. Response returns updated file metadata/content.

## Maintenance Flow

- Health/recover endpoints execute allowlisted OpenClaw commands.
- Output streams into receipts.
- Parent and child receipts are linked in recovery flows.
