This page describes what ClawControl does and how it is intended to be operated in production.

## Product Scope

ClawControl provides:

- Work orchestration: work orders, manager-driven operations, statuses, assignees, and deterministic YAML workflows.
- Governance: risk policies, approvals, and typed confirmation enforcement for protected actions.
- Runtime visibility: activity feeds, receipt streaming, OpenClaw session and usage telemetry.
- Workspace operations: controlled browsing/editing under workspace path policy.
- Operational controls: maintenance actions, gateway checks, diagnostics, and recovery flows.

## Local-first Model

ClawControl is intentionally local-first:

- Next server startup is guarded by `/scripts/local-only.mjs`, which rejects non-loopback host overrides.
- API proxy rejects non-loopback Host headers with `403`.
- Settings API enforces loopback-only gateway URLs and rejects non-loopback values with `NON_LOOPBACK_FORBIDDEN`.

## Process Components

- Web app: Next.js pages and API routes in `/apps/clawcontrol`.
- Desktop app: Electron shell in `/apps/clawcontrol-desktop` that manages local server lifecycle.
- OpenClaw adapter: command allowlists and discovery in `/packages/adapters-openclaw`.
- Shared policy/types: governor and core domain types in `/packages/core`.

## OpenClaw Behavior

- ClawControl probes OpenClaw CLI and gateway capabilities.
- When OpenClaw is unavailable, OpenClaw-backed features return unavailable/degraded states and empty real-data views.
- No mock/demo fallback is injected for unavailable OpenClaw data.
