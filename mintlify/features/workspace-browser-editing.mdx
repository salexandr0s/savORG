title: Workspace Browser and Editing
---

This page documents the workspace UI and filesystem action model.

## UI Capabilities

Workspace page supports:

- directory browsing
- file read/edit/write
- file/folder creation and deletion
- favorites and recents
- calendar view with day/week/month/year modes
- sort modes (`name`, `recentlyEdited`, `newestCreated`, `oldestCreated`)

## Protected Files

Protected root files receive stricter gating behavior. Current protected mapping includes:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `routing.yaml`

Protected edits require typed confirmation with policy mapping.

## API Surface Used

- `/api/workspace`
- `/api/workspace/:id`
- `/api/workspace/favorites`
- `/api/workspace/recents`
- `/api/workspace/calendar`

## Safety Controls

All file actions pass workspace path policy and root constraints.
