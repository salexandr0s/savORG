This page describes model configuration and auth status visibility.

## Implemented Views

Models page loads in parallel:

- model status (`modelsApi.getStatus()`)
- model list action (`modelsApi.runAction('list')`)

## What It Shows

- default model and fallback chain
- provider authentication state
- model inventory grouped by provider
- aliases and availability metadata

## Model Add Flow

The UI includes add-model flow and refresh logic after successful add.

## Notes

Model behavior depends on OpenClaw configuration and provider auth state. ClawControl shows current real status; it does not synthesize fake model data.
