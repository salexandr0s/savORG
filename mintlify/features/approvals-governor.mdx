title: Approvals and Governance
---

This page documents policy enforcement behavior for protected actions.

## Governor Policy Model

Policies define:

- risk level (`safe`, `caution`, `danger`)
- confirm mode (`NONE`, `CONFIRM`, `WO_CODE`)
- approval requirement and approval type

## Enforcement Paths

Server-side enforcement:

- `withGovernor()` for approval + typed confirm gates
- `enforceActionPolicy()` for typed-confirm-only actions
- `enforceGovernor()` when a route cannot use the wrapper pattern

## Approval Lifecycle

Approvals are persisted with statuses:

- `pending`
- `approved`
- `rejected`

UI supports individual and batch approval decisions.

## Typical Error Patterns

Protected route failures return structured errors such as:

- `APPROVAL_REQUIRED`
- `APPROVAL_PENDING`
- `APPROVAL_REJECTED`
- `TYPED_CONFIRM_REQUIRED`
- `TYPED_CONFIRM_INVALID`
