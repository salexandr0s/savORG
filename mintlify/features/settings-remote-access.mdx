title: Settings and Remote Access
---

This page describes implemented settings behavior, including remote access mode.

## Settings Stored

Config API persists:

- `gatewayHttpUrl`
- `gatewayWsUrl`
- `gatewayToken`
- `workspacePath`
- `remoteAccessMode`
- `setupCompleted`

## Remote Access Mode Values

- `local_only`
- `tailscale_tunnel`

No other mode is accepted by the settings API.

## Loopback Validation

Settings update rejects non-loopback gateway URLs with `NON_LOOPBACK_FORBIDDEN`.

Accepted hosts include loopback values such as:

- `127.0.0.1`
- `localhost`
- `::1`

## Desktop-specific UX

In desktop mode, settings page can:

- open native directory picker
- request local server restart after workspace change
- show independent Gateway reachability and CLI availability indicators

## Explicit Policy

- ClawControl remains loopback-only regardless of selected remote mode.
- Remote mode indicates planned tunnel workflow, not bind exposure behavior.
- `tailscale serve` remains disallowed.
