This page describes the workflows, teams, and package management surface in ClawControl.

## Workflows

The Workflows page supports:

- list built-in + custom workflows
- stage/usage inspection
- create/edit custom workflow YAML
- clone built-in workflow to custom
- import workflow YAML
- export workflow YAML

Built-in workflows are read-only.

## Teams

Teams are first-class records linked to agents.

Teams support:

- create/edit/delete
- member assignment via agent linkage
- linked workflow/template metadata
- team export

## Package Artifacts

ClawControl package artifacts (`.clawpack.zip`) support four package kinds:

- `agent_template`
- `agent_team`
- `workflow`
- `team_with_workflows`

Package flow is Analyze -> Deploy.

## Workspace Outputs

Workflow snapshots are written to workspace:

- `/workflows/clawcontrol-resolved-workflows.yaml`
- `/workflows/clawcontrol-resolved-selection.yaml`

Package history traces are written to:

- `/workflow-packages/history/*.json`
