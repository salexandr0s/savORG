title: Contributing and Docs Maintenance
---

This page defines how to maintain this Mintlify docs site.

## Docs Source of Truth

When updating docs, prioritize:

1. runtime behavior in code
2. existing operator docs in `docs/`
3. release workflow and scripts

## Update Process

1. edit files under `mintlify/`
2. run docs checks:

```bash
cd mintlify
npm install
npm run check
```

3. verify cross-links and navigation updates in `docs.json`

## Authoring Rules

- no placeholders like `TBD`
- no invented product behavior
- keep loopback/tunnel-only and unsigned-desktop warnings explicit
- include `Last updated` and `Related pages` sections on each page

## Versioning and Release Coordination

When release behavior changes (installation, checksums, trust model), update:

- quickstart release page
- operations release/checksum page
- docs publishing runbook if publish flow changes
