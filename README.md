# savORG Mission Control

Mission Control for [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw): a multi-agent operating system with governance, live monitoring, receipts, and approval gates.

**Status:** Alpha (v0.1.0) — suitable for local development and experimentation.

---

## What It Is

SAVORG Mission Control is a local-first ops console for orchestrating AI agents. It provides:

- **Work Orders** — Track feature work through spec → build → QA → ship stations
- **Agent Management** — Configure, monitor, and control AI agents via souls and overlays
- **Approval Gates** — Governor-enforced typed confirmation for dangerous actions
- **Live View** — Real-time streaming of agent activities and command receipts
- **Workspace** — Browse and edit agent files (souls, overlays, skills, playbooks)
- **Plugins & Skills** — Install and manage agent capabilities
- **Templates** — Create agents from validated templates with parameterized rendering

## Requirements

| Requirement | Version | Notes |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| **Node.js** | 20+ | See `.nvmrc` |
| **npm** | 10+ | Included with Node 20 |
| **OS** | macOS | Linux likely works (untested) |
| **OpenClaw** | 0.1.0+ | Required for operational mode |

### Checking Prerequisites

```bash
# Node version
node -v  # Should be v20.x or higher

# OpenClaw (optional for demo mode)
which openclaw  # Should return a path
openclaw --version  # Should be 0.1.0 or higher
```

> **Note:** Legacy `clawdbot` CLI is not supported. If you're using clawdbot, please upgrade to OpenClaw first.

## Quickstart

```bash
# 1. Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/your-org/savorgos.git
cd savorgos
npm install

# 2. Configure environment
cp apps/mission-control/.env.example apps/mission-control/.env

# 3. Initialize database
npm run db:migrate

# 4. Start development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Demo Mode vs Operational Mode

Mission Control supports two modes:

### Demo Mode (Default)

When OpenClaw is not installed or not on PATH, Mission Control runs with:

- **Mock data** — Pre-populated work orders, agents, activities
- **Simulated execution** — Commands return mock results
- **Full UI exploration** — All features accessible for evaluation

This is ideal for:
- Evaluating the UI and workflow
- Development without OpenClaw dependency
- Learning the system before production use

### Operational Mode

When OpenClaw is detected on PATH, Mission Control:

- **Executes real commands** — `openclaw run`, `openclaw speak`, etc.
- **Reads real workspace** — Agent souls, overlays, skills from disk
- **Persists state** — SQLite database with WAL mode
- **Enforces governance** — Governor policies gate dangerous actions

To enable operational mode:
1. Install OpenClaw following their [setup guide](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw)
2. Ensure `openclaw` is on your PATH
3. Restart Mission Control

## Security Model

Mission Control is designed for **local-first, single-user** operation. Key security properties:

### Governor System

All dangerous actions require **typed confirmation**:

```
Action: plugin.install
Policy: CONFIRM
Prompt: "Type 'CONFIRM' to install plugin"
```

Actions are categorized by risk level:
- **ALLOW** — Safe read operations (no confirmation)
- **CONFIRM** — Type "CONFIRM" to proceed
- **WO_CODE** — Type the work order code to proceed
- **DENY** — Blocked entirely

### Path Safety

Workspace file operations enforce:
- No path traversal (`..` rejected)
- No backslashes or null bytes
- Allowlist: `agents`, `overlays`, `skills`, `playbooks`, `plugins`

### Command Allowlist

OpenClaw execution is limited to 24 pre-defined commands:
- No arbitrary shell execution
- `spawn()` used with array arguments (no shell interpolation)

### Audit Trail

All significant actions are logged to the activity feed with:
- Timestamp, actor, action type
- Entity references
- Payload details

See [docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md) for the full threat model.
