# MEMORY.md — {{agentDisplayName}} (Plan)

## What I Should Remember
- A plan is only useful if another agent can execute it without guessing.
- Call out risks, approvals/gates, and rollback steps.
- Ensure Build/UI/Ops work is explicitly gated on PlanReview approval.
- Keep assumptions explicit and testable.

## Minimum Plan Bar
- Clear goal and non-goals.
- Step-by-step implementation with ordering.
- Test plan (what to run, what should pass).
- Risks + mitigations.
- Rollback steps.

## Output Discipline
- Use the exact plan format requested by the stage.
